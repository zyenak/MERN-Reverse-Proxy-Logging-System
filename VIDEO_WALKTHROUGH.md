# Video Walkthrough Script - MERN Reverse Proxy Logging System

## Introduction (0:00 - 1:00)
"Welcome to the MERN Reverse Proxy Logging System demonstration. This is a full-stack TypeScript application built with React, Express.js, MongoDB, and shadcn/ui that simulates a reverse proxy with comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities."

## Project Overview (1:00 - 2:00)
"Let me start by showing you the project structure and key features:
- Professional dashboard with real-time statistics
- Advanced log management with filtering and export
- Proxy rules management with CRUD operations
- User management with role-based access control
- System settings configuration
- Secure authentication with JWT tokens"

## Setup and Installation (2:00 - 4:00)
"First, let's look at the setup process. The project uses a modern tech stack with TypeScript throughout. The backend runs on Express.js with MongoDB, while the frontend uses React with Vite and shadcn/ui components.

To get started:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for both client and server
3. Set up environment variables
4. Create the admin user
5. Start both development servers"

## Authentication System (4:00 - 5:30)
"Let's start with the authentication system. The login page features a clean, professional design with the Ability logo. Users can log in with username and password.

[Demo login process]
- Enter admin credentials
- Show successful login and redirect to dashboard
- Demonstrate the protected route system
- Show how unauthenticated users are redirected to login"

## Dashboard Overview (5:30 - 8:00)
"Now let's explore the main dashboard. This is the heart of the application, providing a comprehensive overview of the system.

[Show dashboard tabs and features]
- **System Overview Tab**: 
  - Total requests, success rate, average response time, active rules
  - Performance metrics with visual progress bars
  - Proxy status and configuration details

- **Proxied Users Tab**:
  - Display user data fetched from the target API (jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
  - Show how the reverse proxy forwards requests and displays results
  - Demonstrate the table with user information

- **Recent Activity Tab**:
  - Real-time log of proxy requests
  - Color-coded status indicators
  - Method badges and response times"

## Proxy Functionality (8:00 - 10:00)
"Let's demonstrate the core proxy functionality. The system acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to the target API while logging all activity.

[Demo proxy requests]
- Show how requests to /api/proxy/users are forwarded to jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
- Demonstrate different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Show how requests are logged with timestamps, response times, and status codes
- Explain the proxy rule matching system"

## Log Management (10:00 - 13:00)
"Now let's explore the comprehensive log management system. This is where you can monitor and analyze all proxy activity.

[Show logs page features]
- **Advanced Filtering**:
  - Search by method, status, date range
  - Filter by specific criteria
  - Real-time search functionality

- **Log Details**:
  - Click on any log entry to view detailed information
  - Show metadata, request/response details
  - Display associated proxy rules

- **Bulk Operations**:
  - Export logs as JSON files
  - Delete individual logs
  - Clear all logs with confirmation

- **Pagination and Performance**:
  - Efficient pagination for large datasets
  - Loading states and error handling"

## Proxy Rules Management (13:00 - 16:00)
"The proxy rules system allows you to configure how requests are handled, logged, and potentially blocked.

[Demo proxy rules features]
- **Creating Rules**:
  - Set path patterns (e.g., /api/*, /users/:id)
  - Configure HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Set priority levels for rule matching
  - Configure logging and blocking behavior

- **Rule Management**:
  - Toggle rules on/off
  - Enable/disable logging for specific rules
  - Block requests based on rules
  - Edit and delete existing rules

- **Rule Priority**:
  - Show how rules are matched by priority
  - Demonstrate rule conflicts and resolution"

## User Management (16:00 - 18:00)
"The user management system provides administrative control over system access and permissions.

[Show user management features]
- **User Listing**:
  - Display all system users
  - Show roles, status, and login activity
  - Search and filter users

- **User Operations**:
  - Create new users with roles
  - Edit user information and permissions
  - Activate/deactivate user accounts
  - Delete users with confirmation

- **Role-based Access**:
  - Admin vs User permissions
  - Demonstrate access control
  - Show how different roles see different features"

## System Settings (18:00 - 20:00)
"The settings page allows administrators to configure system behavior and performance.

[Show settings configuration]
- **Proxy Settings**:
  - Configure target API URL
  - Set timeout and retry limits
  - Enable/disable caching

- **Logging Settings**:
  - Set log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
  - Configure retention policies
  - Enable/disable request/response logging

- **Security Settings**:
  - Configure rate limiting
  - Set CORS policies
  - JWT validation settings
  - Session timeout configuration
